         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I recently made the exciting decision to retrain as a JavaScript Software Developer.
Since a young age, I have been passionate about creating dynamic, exciting and
user-friendly websites. For example, as a child I ran my own website dedicated to my
favourite TV show, <em>Doctor Who</em>. For my group project at the end of my Northcoders
bootcamp, I used Phaser and Socket.io to create a multiplayer game called Geist.io, in
which spirits battle against each other, à la Pokémon. I am also fascinated by the
potential that AI has to transform all industries, not least software development.</p>
