         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I recently made the exciting decision to retrain as a JavaScript Software Developer. Since a young age, I have been passionate about creating dynamic, exciting and user-friendly websites. For example, as a child I ran my own website dedicated to my favourite TV show, <em>Doctor Who</em>. For my group project at the end of my Northcoders bootcamp, I used Phaser and Socket.io to create a multiplayer game called <em>Geist.io</em>, in which spirits battle against each other, à la <em>Pokémon</em>. I am also fascinated by the potential that AI has to transform all industries, not least software development.</p>

         <h2>Professional Development</h2>
         <h3><strong>Trainee Software Developer</strong>, Northcoders, <em>October 2024 - January 2025</em></h3>
         <p>Over the course of this 13-week Software Development in JavaScript Skills Bootcamp, I have developed all of the skills necessary to become a fully-fledged software developer. I have learned about all the fundamentals of coding in JavaScript, both in the backend and frontend. I also regularly practiced paired programming. I have really enjoyed the challenge that comes with undertaking such an intensive and interesting course.</p>

         <h3><a href="https://github.com/ChrisDobson/my-nc-news/blob/main/README.md">My-NC-News</a> (backend project)</h3>
         <p>In week 7 of the bootcamp, I used Supabase and Render to create an Application Programming Interface that is globally accessible. It relies on a database of articles, comments, topics and users that I accessed using PSQL. In Visual Studio Code, I ran more than 50 tests to ensure that my API functioned as expected. I wrote a blogpost about my experience, which can be viewed <a href="https://chrisdobson.github.io/web/page">here</a>.</p>

         <p><em><a href="https://northcoders-app.netlify.app">Northcoders News</a></em> is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website, hosted through Netlify. Users can read a variety of articles, post comments and either upvote or downvote articles. Users can also filter articles according to three different parameters and I added the ability to toggle between a light and a dark mode.</p>

         <h2>Employment History</h2>
         <h3><strong>Tower of London Warden</strong>, Historic Royal Palaces, <em>November 2023 - August 2024</em></h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Customer service: Every day I welcomed thousands of people to the UK’s most popular paid tourist attraction and I ensured that they all enjoyed a seamless visit.</li>
            <li>Security: I used my radio to communicate with a large team of colleagues across several departments. I kept all visitors safe and calm in the event of an emergency, e.g.a first aid incident or a lost child.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3><strong>Foyles Children's Bookseller</strong>, Waterstones, <em>June 2023 - October 2023</em></h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Retail: With my passion for literature, I excelled in upselling our books of the month.</li>
            <li>Stock replenishment: I kept track of customers’ orders using an online database and I processed their deliveries.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3><strong>Usher at the Harold Pinter Theatre</strong>, ATG Entertainment, <em>January 2023 - June 2023</em></h3>
         <ul>
            <li>First aid: In theatres, there are often first aid incidents. I always responded proactively, by attending to the customer in need and ensuring other theatre patrons that we had the situation under control. Clear communication is key in events like this.</li>
            <li>Bar work: Fulfilling dozens of customers’ orders in a short space of time requires the ability to cope under pressure and think on your feet. I enjoyed the sociable nature of chatting with theatre patrons and upselling them other products, such as programmes.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3><strong>Usher at the Palace Theatre</strong>, Nimax Theatres, <em>October 2021 - December 2022</em></h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Team supervisor: As a cover supervisor, I delegated tasks to a small team of fellow ushers. We worked closely and communicated effectively over the radio, which helped when it came to handling incidents such as a theatre patron falling ill during a performance.</li>
            <li>Fire warden: Before, during and after every performance, I checked that the theatre’s fire exits were clear. Every week, we practiced a fire drill, which ensured that we were prepared for a real emergency situation, such as an invacuation or evacuation of the building.</li>
         </ul>
